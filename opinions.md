if I can avoid allocations, I will.

though, I want the language to be of the simpliest class as possible, so you shouldn't have to look more than one character at the same time

everything needs to make sort of sense before printing anything, this is why I do *not* write the output while reading the file (despite it being possible, but that output would be useless if it becomes unsure of what the user want)
